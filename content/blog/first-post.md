description: What's this blog for, you might ask?
---

Hey y'all! This is the start of my brand new blog - I've been toying around with the idea of starting something like this to motivate me to write and get my thoughts out more for quite some time, and finally decided to pull the trigger.

I'm intending on using this as an outlet for thoughts on life, books, podcasts, cooking, and everything in between. My current book of choice is [Ego is the Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818) by Ryan Holiday, and there's a quote I recently read that was particularly outstanding to me:

> General George C. Marshall—essentially the opposite of McClellan even though they briefly held the same position a few generations apart—refused to keep a diary during World War II despite the requests of historians and friends. He worried that it would turn his quiet, reflective time into a sort of performance and self-deception.

The purpose of this blog isn't to show off to others or lie to myself about my life or the experiences that I have. Rather, I see it as just a outlet for me to share my thoughts, and secondarily to encourage myself to write and reflect on a regular cadence. I have no intention to sugarcoat any of the events/topics that you may go on to read here. This is pure, unfiltered Anish for you.

Get hype.
